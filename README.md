## Overview
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the "Data Structures and Algorithms Mastery" course. In this repository, you'll find my solutions to the 5 easy challenges related to single linked lists.

## Tasks : Home Work 2 
### Task 1:  Delete with key 
● Given a list, delete the first node with the given key value <br>
● E.g. {1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 6}, key = 2 ⇒ {1, 3, 4, 2, 6}

### Task 2: Swap each pair vales
● Given a list, swap each 2 consecutive values  <br>
● E.g. {1, 2, 3, 4} ⇒ {2, 1, 4, 3}  <br>
● E.g. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ⇒ {2, 1, 4, 3, 5}  <br>

### Task 3:  Reverse list nodes
● Given a list, reverse all its nodes (addresses)  <br>
● E.g. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ⇒ {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}  <br>

### Task 4:  Delete even positions
● Given a list, delete all nodes at even positions (2, 4, 6, etc)  <br>
● E.g. {1, 2, 3, 4, 10} ⇒ {1, 3, 10}  <br>
● E.g. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ⇒ {1, 3, 5}  <br>
● Note: positions NOT values

### Task 5:   Insert to be sorted
● Implement: void insert_sorted(int value) <br>
● It will always insert the value in position so that list is sorted <br>
● Let’s insert values: 10 2 30 4 1 <br>
● insert(10) ⇒ {10} <br>
● insert(2) ⇒ {2, 10} <br>
● insert(30) ⇒ {2, 10, 30} <br>
● insert(4) ⇒ {2, 4, 10, 30} <br>
● insert(1) ⇒ {1, 2, 4, 10, 30} <br>
